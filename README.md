# PopularMovies-Stage-2

My Udacity project for Popular Movies, Stage 2 using Android Studio.

For Stage 1, This app will: Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.

Allow your user to change sort order via a menu setting: The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated.

Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as: original title, movie poster, image thumbnail, a plot synopsis, user rating, and release date.

For Stage 2, You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).

You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.

You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.

You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.

**To use this app you will need to use your themoviesdb.org API key in Constants.java with this variable: API_KEY
