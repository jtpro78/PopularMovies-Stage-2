# PopularMovies-Stage-1
My Udacity project for Popular Movies Stage 1 using Android Studio.

This app will:
Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.

Allow your user to change sort order via a menu setting:
The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated.

Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
original title,
movie poster,
image thumbnail,
A plot synopsis,
user rating, 
release date

To use this app you will need to use your themoviesdb.org API key in Constants.java with this variable:
API_KEY
